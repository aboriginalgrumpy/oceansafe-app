OceanSafe AI is a machine learning app that predicts shark risks using Random Forest and provides safety advice using Google Gemini LLM.
Planning a beach trip can be stressful because it is difficult for the average person to know it the water is actually safe.
Currently, swimmers have to check multiple different sources for weather, tides and surf conditions, but they often dont know how these factors combine to increase specific risks like shark activity.
This lack of clarity leads to either poor safety decisions or unnecessary anxiety.
My project solves this by automating that complex analysis at home, giving users a simple and clear answer so they can make informed decisions before they travel
